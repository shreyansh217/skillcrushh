<h1>I know how it feels to be unemployed with no clear path forward</h1>

<h2>
ADDA BIRNIR | CEO OF SKILLCRUSH</h2>
<h3 id="a">
	Back in 2009, during the last economic recession, I was totally lost. I had been laid off with zero savings, and I remember feeling like getting a new job, in that economic climate, was an impossible task.<br>
<br>So how did I get from where I was in 2009 to where I am today—doing a job that I love, a job that gives me flexibility, allows me to pay my bills, and plan for the future? I learned technical skills.<br><br>It wasn’t easy, and I didn’t do it overnight, but that decision—to gain clear, marketable, technical skills—changed everything. And I know it can change everything for you too!

	<h2>CAITLIN MARSHALL | WEB DEVELOPER, OWL’S HEAD SOLUTIONS<br><br>
	<p>I found Skillcrush by looking up “rad awesome women who code stuff” and it was just so friendly. I was delighted that it could not only be brain stimulating but also fun. I knew that would motivate me to keep up with the lessons. In the end, it was less than a year from starting classes to becoming a paid web developer…it can happen fast. I have two little boys. I feel proud that they can say my mom’s a web developer. She’s the software engineer. That’s really cool. I like that.</p></h2>

<h1>From teacher to Software Engineer in only 5 months!</h1><br>
<p class="p11">If you are a career changer, Skillcrush is the BEST program out there. You will not find a better, more cost-effective bootcamp experience out there. I signed up for two tracks: Frontend Developer and the Get Hired Tracks. It cost exponentially less than every other option out there that provides live support and access to coaching. Thanks to Skillcrush, the process from starting the first lesson to the job offer was five months. I not only got a job offer from a major company, but Skillcrush also coached me on how to increase my salary and benefits upward. I cannot more highly recommend Skillcrush and their team. They guided me from start to finish towards a new career that will change life for myself and my family. Check them out – you won’t be sorry!</p>
